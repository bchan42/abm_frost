## Robustness of an Agent-Based Model on Cardiac Action Potentials

### Abstract: 
Heart arrhythmias, marked by irregular heartbeats, present serious health risks such as stroke and heart failure. Despite their impact, the exact cause is unknown, but it has been linked to action potential propagation failure. However, mechanisms behind propagation of action potentials are inadequate for capturing the complex dynamics of cardiac tissue.

Accurate modeling of cardiac action potentials is crucial for advancing treatment and prevention strategies. Our research develops an agent-based model (ABM) to simulate these action potentials. The ABM provides a dynamic representation of cardiac tissue, enabling the exploration of arrhythmia scenarios and their effects on heart function.

The model's insights will enhance the understanding of arrhythmia mechanisms and support the identification of potential triggers. Future work will leverage this model to analyze arrhythmia causes and develop targeted interventions, advancing cardiac research and therapeutic approaches.
